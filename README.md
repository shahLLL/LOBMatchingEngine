# 👀 Overview
This is a highly optimised C++ repository of a [Limit Order Book Matching Engine](https://medium.com/@samiur1998/what-is-a-limit-order-book-f48f32915036).

This codebase has been developed using C++23 and uses [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) as a testing framework.

This project has been throughly tested with 36 test cases and over 500 assertions.
```
All tests passed (539 assertions in 36 test cases)
```

The following optimisations and techniques have been incorporated in this project:
- **Array-Based Price Ladder:** Used instead of a Red-Black Tree. Removes the need for dynamic allocation on hot paths and reduces cache misses by
providing sequential memory access.
- **BitMap and Bit Operations:** Allows for more effecient non-linear traversal of the price ladder for both bids and asks.
- **Best Bid/Ask Cursors:** Allows for O(1) access to both best bid and ask prices.
- **Reserving Capacity for Vectors:** Reduces memory overhead for per order dynamic heap allocation.
- **Intrusive Linked List**: Reduces memory allocations, elimanates cache thrashing, and provides true O(1) deletion. 
- **Ordered Map:** Used for effecient O(1) order lookup and delete.
- **Custom Pool Allocator:** Improves speed of memory allocation and reduces memory fragmentation.
- **Pragma Pack:** C++ directive used to optimise memory by eliminating or reducing alignment padding waste.
- **Use of Final Specifier:** Classes and Structs are marked as final, preventing inheritance and enabling the compiler to improve performance through devirtualization.

With the optimisations above the following benchmarks have been achieved on a standard MacBook Air with an [Apple M4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M4) memory chip and 16GB of memory, compiled with **AppleClang 17.0.0.17000013**:
